                   <h3>His Early Childhood Days – 1955</h3>
                   <p>Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, to parents Joanne Simpson and Abdulfattah Jandali. He was later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs with whom he moved to Mountain View, California.

                    As a child, Jobs was interested in engineering and electronics and took apart various items to see how they worked. He later attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California.</p>
                   <h3>A Chance Internship at HP – 1968</h3>
                   <p>As a continuation of his interest in electronics, Steve Jobs called up Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, in search of spare parts to build a frequency counter. Impressed by Jobs’ attention to detail, he was granted the parts as well as an internship for the summer.</p>
                   <h3>Steve Jobs’ foray into big things – 1974</h3>
                   <li>Steve Jobs then returned to California and began a brief stint as a technician at Atari, a video game manufacturer. While here, Jobs’ gets in touch with Wozniak and enlists his help in deciding on the hardware required for the prototype for a single-player game called Pong, which would later be known as Breakout.

                    In the summer of 1974, Jobs traveled to India with a friend to visit ashrams and experience Buddhism. Upon his return to the US, he began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Steve Wozniak.</li>
                   <h3>The Rise of Apple Computer Inc.- 1976</h3>
                   <p>Wozniak had designed and built his own computer-cum-logic board which he called the Apple I. With Jobs’ help, they founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in 1976 and released their first product, the Apple I, later that year.

                    Apple’s third founder, Ronald Wayne, served as the group’s adult supervisor, drawing up the Apple logo, the partnership agreement, and the manual for Apple I. Afraid of the financial risks, Ronald Wayne gave up his shares for a sum of $2,300 but the Apple I went on to sell for $666.66 a piece by the end of the year.</p>
                   <h3>The Beginning of a Successful Streak – 1977</h3>
                   <p>On January 3, 1977, Apple gets incorporated as an official company , supported by a group of venture capitalists. The company’s second product, the Apple II, plastic encased with color graphics, was released in 1977 and became one of the first commercially successful personal computers. Sales naturally hit more than $1 Million per year!</p>
                   <h3>An Insanely Great Ambition – 1979</h3>
                   <p>While a lot was happening on the Apple front, Steve Jobs along with a few Apple engineers decide to head to a tech demonstration at Xerox Corp’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) where the introduction of new technology, the GUI (Graphical User Interface) was making waves.

                    Jobs and his colleagues were granted three-day access to the PARC facilities by Xerox on the condition that they are allowed to purchase stocks, a total of 100,000 Apple shares, at a pre-IPO price of $10 per share.</p>
                   <h3>Apple Goes Public – 1980</h3>
                   <p>On December 12, 1980, Apple went public and in just its initial public stock offering, managed to raise $110 million, more capital than any IPO since Ford in 1956! They made history that day, creating more millionaires than any other public offering had ever created before.</p>
                   <h3>Apple Gets a New CEO – 1983</h3>
                   <p>After having made a grand entry into the Fortune 500 list of top companies in America, Apple got itself a new Chief Executive Officer in John Sculley, skillfully recruited by Steve jobs. Sculley was the then acting president of PepsiCo, Inc. and was whisked away by a shrewd comment by Steve, “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?”</p>
                   <h3>The Power Struggle and Steve Jobs’ Ousting From Apple – 1985</h3>
                   <p>The conception of the Macintosh made Jobs’ uncompromising nature quite evident, from the design creation to its eventual launch. The resulting disagreements kept festering within the company and concerned Apple employees finally resulting in an open power struggle between Steve Jobs and Apple CEO John Sculley.

                    While the board of directors wanted Sculley to contain Steve and let not his ventures result in expensive forays, Steve jobs instead planned to oust Sculley from his position. When Sculley caught wind of this scheme, he colluded with the stakeholders and finally succeeded in removing Jobs’ from his managerial position.
                    
                    Jobs then resigned from Apple and sold all but one Apple stock. Steve Wozniak also followed suit by de facto resigning from his high position and getting back to the Apple product development team to be more involved in the making than simply reigning.</p>
                   <h3>Steve Jobs Tryst with NeXT and Pixar Animation Studios – 1986</h3>
                   <p>After Apple, Jobs’ then founded NeXT Inc., a computer company that specialized in workstations for universities and businesses; however, NeXT failed to gain traction in the marketplace.

                    The NeXT computer was funded by a Japanese electronics company and was noted for its engineering design. However, it was a costly venture and was eventually eclipsed by more cost-effective competitor products.
                    
                    Soon after, Jobs purchased The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm Ltd., for $5 million. Over the next 15 years, Pixar Animation Studios released some of the most successful animated films of all time including Toy Story (1995), A Bug’s Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters Inc.(2001), Finding Nemo (2003), and more.</p>
                   <h3>The Journey of NeXT and Apple continues – 1987 to 1995</h3>
                   <p>In late 1988, NeXT released its first NeXT computer with a tag of $6,500 a piece. It was received as largely cost-prohibitive due to its advanced workstation, but those who could afford it became its staunch supporters.

                    Steve Jobs managed to market the NeXT products to scientific and academic sponsors due to the innovative technologies incorporated in its production like the built-in Ethernet Port, Mach Kernel, and the digital signal processor chip.
                    
                    After a while, Jobs’ shifted his focus from developing whole computers to largely dealing with software at NeXT.
                    
                    Meanwhile, in 1991, IBM Corp. and Apple ally to develop advanced software and new PC microprocessors. Apple’s PowerBook gets launched, establishing the standard norm for future laptop computers.
                    
                    1993 saw the introduction of Apple’s pen-based computer, Newton. And although it was a huge financial disappointment when launched, it nevertheless paved the way for Apple’s products like the iPhone and iPad in the future.
                    
                    A string of financial failures saw Apple changing hands from CEO John Sculley to president Michael Spindler. Then in 1994, Apple introduces the Power Macintosh Computers and decides to license its OS, thereby allowing its competitors to clone the Mac.
                    
                    In 1995, the first Mac goes live; Microsoft releases its Windows 95 version; and Apple’s financial and existential struggle continues burdened with fierce competition, mistakes concerning customer demand, and component shortages.
                    
                    Contrastingly, Pixar’s Toy Story hits the theaters with an IPO raising $140 million.</p>
                   <h3>Back to Apple – 1996</h3>
                   <p>The administration of Apple changes hands again, from Michael Spindler to Gil Amelio on February 2, 1996. After a thorough briefing on the admin management, Amelio learned that even prolonged efforts could not develop or produce an alternate for the aging Macintosh OS. Instead, he chose to purchase NeXT for $430 Million for the NeXTstep OS that Jobs’ and his team had developed.

                    This decision resulted in Jobs returning to Apple’s management while also laying the base for NeXT technology to become the foundation of the Mac OS X operating system.</p>
                   <h3>Reinventing Apple – 2000 to 2003</h3>
                   <p>Steve Jobs announces his shift to permanent CEO at the 2000 Macworld Expo. The iPod began its evolution as the first portable digital audio player capable of storing up to 1000 songs and diversifying into the iPod Mini versions, iPod Touch, iPod Classic, Shuffle, the iPod Nano, and the iPhone.

                    2001 also saw the unveiling of the Mac OS X aimed at professionals and consumers alike. 2003 saw the launch of the iTunes Music Store to help people buy music online, albeit legally.</p>
                   <h3>Steve Jobs battles health issues – 2003</h3>
                   <p>Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in mid-2003 but put off surgery while seeking alternative medical approaches. In 2004, he underwent the Whipple surgery that seemed to have removed the tumor successfully. In Jobs’ absence, Apple was run by Timothy D. Cook, the head of worldwide sales and operations.</p>
                   <h3>Steve Jobs returns to work – 2004</h3>
                   <p>In February of 2004, Pixar terminates its contracts with Walt Disney Company only to be ultimately sold to Walt Disney in 2006. It is in late September that Steve Jobs returns to work after a brief rest from pancreatic surgery. The total revenue from Apple’s investments rises to $2.35 billion at the end of September.</p>
                   <h3>The Worldwide Developers Conference – 2005 and 2006</h3>
                   <p>Here, Steve Jobs announces the shift from using IBM’s processing chips to Intel Processors for their further innovations. Eventually, 2006 saw the introduction of the first Intel-based devices, the iMac and MacBook Pro with Intel Core Duo processors.</p>
                   <h3>iPhone hits the world – 2007 and beyond</h3>
                   <p>Steve Jobs introduces Apple’s first iPhone to the world at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007 with its official release scheduled on June 29, 2007.

                    The following years saw the release of further innovations like the iPod Touch, the App Store, the MacBook Air, MobileMe, Apple’s cloud offering, iPad, and more.</p>
                   <h3>Steve Jobs’ Health Speculations – 2008</h3>
                   <p>Steve Jobs was always secretive about his health concerns and never voiced them out loud. His drastic weight loss started raising public concerns which amounted to a simple common bug and hormonal imbalance issues. A few days after Steve Jobs declared he was fit to continue working, he took a few days off for a medical leave. It was later learned that Steve Jobs had undergone a liver transplant at the Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
                   <h3>The End of a Great Legend – 2011</h3>
                   <p>In January of 2011, Steve Jobs took a second medical leave of absence with no particular duration raising more speculations about his failing health. While he was still involved in major decision-making processes, Tim Cook was given the heads up to run day-to-day operations.

                    In August of 2011 Jobs finally resigns from his position as CEO of Apple, naturally replaced by COO Tim Cook. On October 5, 2011, Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs passed away at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. His death was widely mourned with many tributes pouring in from around the world.</p>
